Revision history for Perl extension Net::CUPS.

0.20  Thu Apr 10 02:22:16 2003
	- Reworked the framework of the Net::CUPS module.

0.11  Mon Apr 07 12:00:00 2003
	- Added printer configuration option code and documented it.
	- I don't know why, but for some reason the typemap file was missing from
	  the CPAN tarball.  Does 'make dist' not include them in the final
	  package?

	- First public release of Net::CUPS.
