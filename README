Net::CUPS README
================

Net::CUPS is an interface to the Common Unix Printing System API.  
It follows most of the conventions set forth in the C API so anyone
who is familiar with it can easily get acquainted with Net::CUPS. 
The main deviation is the practice of converting the C structs
into Perl hashes for easy modification from a Perl application.

The Common Unix Printing System can be found at http://www.cups.org.

This is just an initial release that needs much more polishing.  The
API may change in the near future based on any feedback I receive.
Please give me feedback concerning this module!
