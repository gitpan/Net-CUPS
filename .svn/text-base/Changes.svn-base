0.50 Fri Feb 15 18:38:28 2007

0.40 Mon Nov 29 20:46:44 2004
	- It was pointed out to me that Network is probably not the best
      name for the integrated IPP and HTTP modules.  Instead they are
      now named Net::CUPS::Protocol.

0.37 Mon Nov  8 23:49:36 2004
	- Net::CUPS::IPP module has been moved to Net::CUPS::Network as the
	  initial plan to have seperate IPP and HTTP modules proved to be
	  an unwise design decision.
	- Added all HTTP constants to Net::CUPS::Network

0.35  Tue Oct 12 23:37:27 2004
	- Upgraded to handle the latest release of CUPS - 1.2.21
	- Added the SUPPORT disclaimer to the POD located in CUPS.pm.
	- Moved all typemaps into a global typemap.

	  area.
	- Fixed issue with running certain functions in Net::CUPS::Printer
	  without having any printers setup in the CUPS config.
	- Added constants to the Net::CUPS::IPP module.

0.20  Thu Apr 10 02:22:16 2003

0.11  Mon Apr 07 12:00:00 2003
	- Added printer configuration option code and documented it.
	- I don't know why, but for some reason the typemap file was missing from
	  the CPAN tarball.  Does 'make dist' not include them in the final
	  package?
