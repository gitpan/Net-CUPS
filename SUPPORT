Net::CUPS SUPPORT
=================

Net::CUPS is an interface to the Common Unix Printing System API.  
It follows most of the conventions set forth in the C API so anyone
who is familiar with it can easily get acquainted with Net::CUPS. 
The main deviation is the practice of converting the C structs
into Perl hashes for easy modification from a Perl application.

The Common Unix Printing System can be found at http://www.cups.org.

This module is offered without any support.  If you have any questions
on how to use this module then you should start by reading the 
"CUPS Software Programmers Manual".  This module is for the most
part a Perl implementation of C API.  If you can use the C API
then you can use this module.  If you find a bug or get stuck feel
free to e-mail, but don't expect an immediate response.  I apologize
for taking this attitude, but several people have e-mailed me in the
past and were quite abbrasive with their correspondence.
